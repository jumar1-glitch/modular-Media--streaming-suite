# Modular Media Streaming Suite â€“ Architectural Overview

## ðŸ§© Overview
This project follows a modular, layered architecture for efficient media streaming, integration, and scalability.

---

## **1. Presentation Layer**
- Handles playback, authentication, and user controls.

## **2. Application/API Layer**
- Exposes REST APIs for user management, media catalog, and playback sessions.
- Coordinates requests between the UI and backend services.

## **3. Integration Layer (`integ`)**
- Orchestrates communication between subsystems.
- Manages workflows (upload â†’ transcode â†’ publish).
- Connects external services (CDN, DRM, analytics).

## **4. Media Processing & Storage**
- Ingests uploads or live feeds.
- Transcodes and stores HLS/DASH segments.
- Interfaces with CDN for content delivery.

## **5. Analytics & Monitoring**
- Tracks playback metrics, logs, and system performance.

## **6. Security & Infrastructure**
- Uses authentication, DRM, containerized microservices, and CI/CD pipelines.
